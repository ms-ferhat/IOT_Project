# IoT Applications Development 

> Welcome to the IoT Applications Development ! In this rebo, you will learn how to develop IoT applications using the Master of Things platform and Proteus for simulation, instead of using real hardware. This is an excellent approach for those who want to focus on the design and programming aspects without needing physical devices.

## Overview  
Platform: Master of Things **(MOT)**  
Simulation Tool: **Proteus**  
Language: **Embedded C, JavaScript, MQTT**

## What You'll Learn:  
- How to develop IoT applications without physical hardware.  
- How to use Master of Things to simulate real-world IoT projects.  
- How to use Proteus for virtual circuit design and testing.  
- How to integrate mobile apps and web interfaces with IoT systems.  
- How to communicate with embedded systems using MQTT.  

## Projects:  
1- LED Blink Control   

## How to Get Started:  
- Sign up on Master of Things.  
- Install Proteus and familiarize yourself with its simulation environment.  
- Follow the projects provided in the course to build IoT systems step by step.
